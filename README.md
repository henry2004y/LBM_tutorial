# LBM_tutorial
Collection of LBM codes in Julia.

This serves as a starting point of writing Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) in Julia. Some of the codes are inherited from their Matlab predecessors on the web; others are written following the ideas in the book by A.A.Mohamad.

## Contents

1. simple
  Simple codes collected and modified from the web.
2. Diffusion
  1D and 2D diffusion equation solvers
3. Advection-Diffusion
  1D and 2D advection-diffusion equation solvers. 2D is not complete.
